# Project Design & Technology Choices

This README provides insights into the design decisions, technologies used and challenge faced during the development of the project.

### User Interface (UI) Design
A fixed side bar is opted for to display search word history. It offers immediate visibility to users, making it easier for them to access their search word history without the need for additional interactions.

### Technology Stack
**Vite-React:** The project is built using Vite with React. Vite is chosen for its speed and lightweight development environment, making it easy to start and develop the project rapidly.
<br>

**TypeScript:** TypeScript has been included in the technology stack to enhance type safety and prevent bugs. It provides static typing, which helps catch errors during development.

### Challenges Faced
**Session Storage:** Learning about sessionStorage for the first time and understanding how to use it effectively for data management ( storing, retrieving and updating history ) and data persistence during a user's session.
<br><br>
**Data from Fetch API:** Efficiently handling data obtained from the Fetch API, including parsing, storing, and displaying it to the user.
<br><br>
**Component Styling:** Ensuring that the sidebar and other UI elements are styled appropriately and responsive across different screen sizes and devices.
