# Project Design & Technology Choices

This README provides insights into the design decisions, technologies used and challenge faced during the development of the project.

### User Interface (UI) Design

**Fixed Side Bar:** It offers immediate visibility to users, making it easier for them to access their search word history without the need for additional interactions.

**Word of the Day:** When users first land on our page, they are greeted with a daily word, its pronunciation, and its definition. This not only adds value to their visit but also engages and educates them. It's a small touch that enhances the user experience.

### Technology Stack

**Vite-React:** The project is built using Vite with React. Vite is chosen for its speed and lightweight development environment, making it easy to start and develop the project rapidly.
<br>

**TypeScript:** TypeScript has been included in the technology stack to enhance type safety and prevent bugs. It provides static typing, which helps catch errors during development.

### Challenges Faced

**Session Storage:** Learning about sessionStorage for the first time and understanding how to use it effectively for data management ( storing, retrieving and updating history ) and data persistence during a user's session.
<br><br>
**Data from Fetch API:** Efficiently handling data obtained from the Fetch API, including parsing, storing, and displaying it to the user.
<br><br>
**Component Styling:** Ensuring that the sidebar and other UI elements are styled appropriately and responsive across different screen sizes and devices.
